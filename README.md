## Overview

This platform analyzes publicly available Medicare Advantage enrollment data covering over 36 million
members across all 50 states and thousands of counties. It answers four practical business questions:

1. **Where is enrollment growing fastest, and where is the untapped opportunity?**
2. **Which insurance payers are growing quickly and worth prioritizing for outreach?**
3. **Where is prior-authorization workload concentrated, so teams can plan capacity?**
4. **What is that enrollment growth worth in revenue terms?**

Every number shown is backed by a validation check, and every limitation of the underlying public data is
stated openly rather than hidden behind a confident-looking chart.

## Aim

To turn public Medicare Advantage enrollment data into clear, actionable business intelligence for
Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) teams -- showing where enrollment is growing, which insurance payers to
prioritize, where prior-authorization workload is concentrated, and what that growth is worth in dollars.

---

## Problem Statement

RCM and business development teams need to know where to focus their limited time and resources: which
states and counties are growing, which insurance payers are the best partners to pursue, and where
administrative workload (like prior authorization) is likely to be heaviest. Public government data holds
the answers, but it is large, partly hidden (some rows are suppressed for privacy), and easy to
misinterpret if not handled carefully. Teams need this turned into a single, trustworthy, easy-to-read
platform -- not a spreadsheet full of gaps and guesswork.

## Key Features

- **Honest enrollment reporting** -- every figure is shown as a range, reflecting real data limitations
  instead of hiding them
- **Proven forecasting** -- the enrollment forecast is validated across 15 independent tests and clearly
  beats a simple baseline
- **State and county-level market opportunity ranking** -- stress-tested against different scoring
  assumptions
- **Payer scorecard** -- ranks insurance companies by growth, size, and administrative burden
- **Prior-authorization exposure view** -- shows authorization workload by plan and by member volume
- **Revenue estimation** -- converts enrollment growth into a clearly labeled low / base / high range
- **Built-in validation dashboard** -- every underlying check is visible, with real pass/fail results
- **One-click, repeatable pipeline** -- the entire analysis can be rerun end-to-end at any time

## Architecture

Data flows in one direction, start to finish: public CMS data is loaded and cleaned, growth and
forecasting analysis run on top of it, prior-authorization and payer data are layered in, and every
result flows into a single validated dashboard -- so nothing shown to the end user skips the checks along
the way.

---

## Dashboard

**Executive Overview** -- a single-page summary of the most important numbers: current enrollment,
growth rate, the best-performing forecast model, and the top opportunity markets.

**Proxy Revenue** -- converts the enrollment forecast into a clearly labeled revenue estimate range,
with the underlying assumption stated in plain language.

## Benefits

- **Focus where it pays off** -- teams see exactly which states and counties have the most growth
  potential, and can trust the ranking because it has been stress-tested
- **Smarter payer outreach** -- RCM teams know which payers to prioritize for partnership and outreach
- **Better capacity planning** -- knowing where prior-authorization workload is concentrated helps teams
  plan staffing ahead of time
- **Numbers you can rely on** -- every figure is backed by a visible check, and data limitations are stated
  openly instead of hidden
- **Clear money view** -- revenue is shown as a transparent range, never a single misleading number
- **Always up to date** -- the whole analysis can be rerun as new public data becomes available

## Conclusion

This platform turns publicly available Medicare Advantage data into a trustworthy, decision-ready
business intelligence tool for RCM teams. Every number shown is backed by a visible, auditable check, and
every limitation of the underlying public data is stated openly rather than hidden. The result is a
platform that RCM and business teams can genuinely rely on to decide where to focus growth efforts, which
payers to prioritize, and where to plan for administrative workload -- with the confidence that comes from
knowing exactly how each number was produced and verified.
