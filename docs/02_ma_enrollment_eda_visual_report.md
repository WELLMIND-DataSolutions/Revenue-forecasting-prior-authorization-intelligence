# Notebook 02 EDA Visual Report

This GitHub-readable report was generated from `notebooks/02_ma_enrollment_eda.ipynb` because GitHub can fail to render large/output-heavy notebooks cleanly. The original notebook remains in the `notebooks/` folder with all code, cells, and outputs.

## Handling Policy

- Missing/unusable values are profiled before modeling.
- CMS suppressed enrollment values are retained and flagged, not dropped.
- Duplicate business keys are summarized and handled through traceable aggregation.
- Outliers are flagged for review and retained in the modeling-ready tables.
- Forecasting uses observed numeric enrollment totals and does not convert enrollment to assumed PMPM revenue.
